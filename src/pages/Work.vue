      <h2>Game Development</h2>
      <p>
        Most of my game development experience has arisen from personal projects and game jams. As the owner of
        <a
          href="https://thought-reactor.net"
        >Thought Reactor</a>, my mission is to create engaging and challenging games that incorperate puzzles.
      </p>

      <h2>Web Development</h2>
      <p>As a professional and hobbyist I have built B2B marketing-driven websites, learning development applications, and many small web apps.</p>

# Personal Website for Michael DeLally

This JAMstack website requires the **Gridsome CLI** for development and deployment. To get started, run the following from your terminal:

```
npm install -g @gridsome/cli
```

Or with Yarn:

```
npm install --global @gridsome/cli
```

Feel free to clone this repo to see how I've built the site using Gridsome & Vue.js!

Once cloned, simply run the following in your terminal app of choice:

```
npm install
```

Once all the dependencies have been installed, you can run the following command to start developing on a local server with hot reload and file watchers:

```
gridsome develop
```

When you're ready to go live, you can build for production with this:

```
gridsome build
```
